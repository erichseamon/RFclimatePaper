Overview:

The following analyses examine agricultural commodity loss, at a county level, from 2001-2015, across the 24 county region of the Inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW). In this analysis, we use a time lagged matrix approach to examine a range of combinations of climate and insurance loss for wheat due to drought.

Data Access:

Data provided include climate correlations, climate matrices, climatological data taken from Abatzoglou's (2013) GRIDMET daily downscaled climate data, as well as wheat commodity pricing data at a county level.

User should only need to download the attached zip file, decompress, and then run the Rmd from the location of data download.  The Rmd contains code to expand any zip files, and load data needed to re-generate the Rmd output (which is included as an html file).
